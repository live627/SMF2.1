Tentative Roadmap for SMF 1.1:
================================================================================

SMF 1.1 RC2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - resolve any bugs found in Beta 3 or Beta 3 Public.
 - clean up and split some templates to make it easier to modify themes.
 - more comments and better organized code, aka code review.
 - attempt to track down any and all possible injections, and fix them.
 - write up tutorials for very advanced things, introduction to coding style,
   how to write common things for modifications, etc.


Later
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - reply to all, conversations, and such things in PersonalMessage.
 - new download page with options for default language, theme, etc.
 - Dreamweaver/Frontpage "friendly" theme, if possible, using inline PHP.
 - better handling of children and parents where access is absent from parents
   but not from the child.
 - integrate in Jabber with Edgar. (maybe not.)
 - both the from and to board's permissions should be checked on move. (??)
 - don't change email address in profile until it's verified. (maybe RC1/2?)
 - group by group permissions for themes, and better theme settings.
 - offer some themes, and possibly modifications, to Charter Members only.
 - try to get more smiley sets available and options in the packages.
 - have more templates fully commented with documentation.
 - get comments on tutorials and review them, make sure they are still correct.
 - contact some marketing places and try to get them to consider game, project,
   and the like themed themes - like a "Gunbound Theme" for enthusiasts.
   Won't necessarily be free or anything, but might.
 - create a poll for which themes to be used in the next version and ask for
   people to create some - the 1.0 default will be in the list, of course.
 - try to get accessability and usability concerns resolved for any new themes.
